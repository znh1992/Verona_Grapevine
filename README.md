# Verona_Grapevine

This repository is a collection of auxilliary information from the poster presented at the X International
Symposium for Grapevine Physiology and Biotechnology, P207: Long Non-Coding RNAs in Grapevine.

All information contained within only serves as further explanation of the work that was done. 
The few scripts present could be useful to anyone trying to replicate this work until a master pipeline is published.

All scripts will need lines edited to ensure completion. Lines have been flagged with what information should be present. 
For execution, tools are assumed to be root installed (Samtools, SQLite, etc).

These scripts are not inherently guaranteed to work, especially if executed as is.
